# MAT Tracker

## Project brief
This app will help a person to track his physical activity (PA) per week, measureed in METs (metabolic equivalents) to understand if a person meets his recommended WHO (World Health Organisation) levels. This CRUD fullstack app is built up using JavaScript with a React framework (on the frontend), a Mongo database, with an Express framework (on the backend).

### MVP
A user should be able to:
* see a list of exercises
* add entries for each completed exercise per day
* delete any of their daily entries
* update any of the daily entries

### Extentions
* User should be able to create a new exercise
* To create a welcome splash page
* To present a weekly PA total time as a bar chart
